// HostingHelpers — platform-conditional aliases and the single `host(_:)`
// helper every facade routes through to wrap a SwiftUI view in a hosting
// controller and return the controller's `.view` as a raw platform pointer.
//
// Architectural decision (§5.6): one `UIHostingController` per widget facade.
// This matches the "Crystal builds a widget, hands the pointer to a parent"
// model that every existing visit method assumes. Performance optimization
// of nested hosting controllers is explicitly out of scope for Phase 3.
//
// Known SwiftUI quirk addressed here (§5.6): inside `Form` / `List`, a
// `UIViewRepresentable` child can collapse to zero intrinsic size on the
// first layout pass. `host(_:)` wraps every view in
// `.frame(minWidth: 1, minHeight: 1)` so the intrinsic-size invariant
// stays positive on the first pass; the real content size propagates
// normally on the next pass and the 1pt floor is never visible.
//
// `APSKPlatformView` is declared in `Overrides/ViewOverrides.swift` and
// MUST NOT be redeclared here — Swift rejects the duplicate
// `public typealias` (see implementation.md §5.5 + line 701).
